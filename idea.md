# Project Idea Submission

## 1. Project Title
AI-Powered Secure Survey Data Collection & Analysis Tool

## 2. Your Name & Roll Number
Akash Dhar Dubey – 2024-B-21122004B

## 3. Problem Statement
Survey data collection is often slow, error-prone, and lacks real-time validation.
Field surveyors may operate in remote areas with poor connectivity, leading to delays in data submission.
Additionally, sensitive data is sometimes stored without proper encryption, making it vulnerable to breaches.
There is a need for a secure, AI-powered cross-platform system to streamline survey data collection, ensure accuracy, and protect sensitive information.

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
Develop a React Native mobile app for field surveyors and a React.js web dashboard for administrators, backed by a Node.js + MySQL server for secure data storage.
Integrate Python AI/NLP models for:
- Real-time data validation.
- Voice-to-text input conversion.
- Auto-detection of incomplete or inconsistent answers.

All data will be encrypted before storage and transmitted securely to the backend. Offline mode will allow surveys to be conducted in low-connectivity areas, with automatic sync when online.

## 5. Key Features
- AI-powered validation and auto-correction of survey inputs (Python NLP).
- Voice-to-text survey entry for faster data capture.
- End-to-end encryption of sensitive survey data.
- Offline data collection with background sync.
- Geo-tagging of survey responses.
- Real-time analytics dashboard for administrators.

## 6. Target Users / Audience
- Government survey agencies (e.g., NSSO, Census Bureau).
- NGOs conducting large-scale field surveys.
- Research organisations and academic institutions.
- Private companies conducting market research.

## 7. Technology Stack
- **Frontend (Mobile):** React Native (JavaScript)
- **Frontend (Web):** React.js (JavaScript)
- **Backend API:** Node.js + Express (JavaScript)
- **Database:** MySQL (encrypted at rest)
- **AI/NLP Processing:** Python (NLTK, Transformers, OpenAI Whisper API)
- **Security:** AES-256 encryption, SHA-256 hashing
- **Hosting & Cloud:** AWS / Azure

## 8. Expected Outcome
A fully functional mobile + web system that can:
- Collect and validate survey data quickly and securely.
- Reduce manual data entry errors by at least 30–40%.
- Protect sensitive data through encryption and anonymisation.
- Provide real-time analytics and export capabilities for decision-making.

## 9. Timeline
- **Week 1–2:** Requirements gathering & UI/UX design.
- **Week 3–4:** Backend API and database setup (Node.js + MySQL with encryption).
- **Week 5–6:** AI/NLP integration (Python for validation and voice-to-text).
- **Week 7:** React Native mobile app development.
- **Week 8:** React.js web dashboard development.
- **Week 9:** Testing, deployment & documentation.

## 10. Additional Notes
- The system will comply with GDPR and Indian IT Act data protection rules.
- Future enhancements could include predictive analytics and semantic search for survey datasets.
